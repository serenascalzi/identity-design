# Identity Design

## Identity Design Elements
- Who: This design is for current and future members of the Girls Who Code College Loop at UNLV. It incorporates the logo, colors, and typography from the Girls Who Code Design Style Guide, along with official photography, creating an identity consistent with the larger organization.
- What: Users of this design are able to become a member, contact the club, and learn more about the organization from the slideshow. They are also able to view news and events, follow the club on social media, and email questions or errors from the page links.
- Where: This landing page provides an overview of Girls Who Code at UNLV. The page serves as an information hub, linking to additional sites on which the club has a presence, including the UNLV Involvement Center, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

## Norman’s Considerations
- Knowledge in the Head/World: Although this design presents information regarding Girls Who Code at UNLV, it also includes links to additional information about the club and the larger organization. The design acts as a reference from which users can access this information, rather than having to recall it.
- Simplified Structure of Tasks: The buttons, links, and navigational elements in this design dictate the tasks that users are able to perform. These tasks are communicated to users through text and hover effects.
- Mappings: The slideshow includes embedded navigational elements, some of which appear when a user hovers. The page includes buttons and links displayed in close proximity to the text to which they correspond.
- Constraints: The navigational elements in the slideshow constrain users’ movement among elements. The buttons and links throughout the page constrain the tasks and information available to users.
- Error Design: This design is responsive — it is optimized to function and display properly across devices. It also includes a link that generates an email for error reporting.
